# ChatOps Integration
This project aims to integrate chat platforms like *Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Jira* with DevOps tools to facilitate communication and collaboration between development and operations teams. By integrating these tools, teams can streamline their workflows, increase productivity, and reduce the chances of errors and miscommunications.

## Features
- Supports integration with multiple chat platforms such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Jira.
- Integrates with popular DevOps tools like Jenkins, GitHub, and Docker.
- Sends real-time notifications to the appropriate channels, alerting the team to any changes or updates made in the DevOps tools.
- Enables team members to collaborate and communicate within the chat platform, eliminating the need for constant switching between tools

## Installation
To install the ChatOps integration, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Addax101/chatops-integration.git`
- Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
- Configure the integration by setting up the necessary environment variables.
- Run the application: `npm start`

## Configuration
The following environment variables are required to configure the ChatOps integration:

* `CHAT_PLATFORM`: The name of the chat platform you are using (e.g., `Slack`, `MicrosoftTeams`, `Jira`).
* `CHAT_API_KEY`: The API key or access token for your chat platform.
* `DEVOPS_PLATFORM`: The name of the DevOps tool you are using (e.g., `Jenkins`, `GitHub`, `Docker`).
DEVOPS_API_KEY: The API key or access token for your DevOps tool.
* `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL`: The name or ID of the channel where notifications should be sent.


## Usage

Once the integration is set up and running, it will automatically send real-time notifications to the specified channel in your chat platform whenever there are changes or updates made in your DevOps tool. Users can also use the chat platform to communicate and collaborate with their team members, without the need to constantly switch between different tools.
